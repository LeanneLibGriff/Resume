I am a qualified librarian with experience in academic libraries ranging from frontline customer service, information literacy instruction, acquisitions, and resource discovery. I have a flexible, proactive, and collaborative approach combined with a strong focus on quality outcomes for all stakeholders.
I am passionate about the positive impact libraries have on university outcomes from the student experience through to research impact.
