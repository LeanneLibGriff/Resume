I am a qualified librarian with experience in academic libraries ranging from frontline customer service, information literacy instruction, acquisitions, and resource discovery. I have a flexible, proactive, and collaborative approach combined with a strong focus on quality outcomes for all stakeholders.
I am passionate about the positive impact libraries have on university outcomes from the student experience through to research impact.

 The project delivered a consistent, quality client experience, promoted collaboration within AES and provided seamless on-boarding of new staff. 
During implementation, the project consulted with several teams including Enterprise Information Systems, Learning Futures, the Accelerated Online Learning team within student administration and Frontline Library Services. 
User testing was conducted with student library rovers and persons external to Griffith to ensure the clarity of student facing instructions and robustness of the recommended platform. 
High quality support resources were developed including How-to videos, email templates, troubleshooting guides and online feedback forms.
